- You'll see a beautiful modern interface with two main sections

### 3. Train Your Models (First Time)
1. Click **"🚀 Train Models"** button
2. Watch the progress bar as models train
3. Training uses your existing data:
   - **Face data**: 26 images from 3 people
   - **Voice data**: 5 samples from 1 person

### 4. Face Recognition
**Option A: Live Camera**
1. Click **"Start Camera"**
2. Position your face in the camera
3. Click **"Capture Photo"**
4. See instant recognition results

**Option B: Upload Image**
1. Drag & drop an image file
2. Or click to browse and select
3. Get recognition results with confidence scores

### 5. Voice Recognition
**Option A: Live Recording**
1. Click **"🎙️ Start Recording"**
2. Speak for 2-3 seconds
3. Click **"⏹️ Stop Recording"**
4. See voice recognition results

**Option B: Upload Audio**
1. Drag & drop an audio file (WAV/MP3)
2. Or click to browse and select
3. Get speaker identification results

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### CNN Architecture
- **Face Model**: 3-layer CNN with 128x128 input
- **Voice Model**: 2D CNN processing MFCC features
- **Training**: Automated with validation splitting
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probability-based recognition

### Modern UI Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, mobile

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Camera not working | Check browser permissions |
| Poor face recognition | Add more training images |
| Audio not recording | Check microphone permissions |
| Models not training | Verify data structure |
| Slow performance | Consider GPU acceleration |

### Getting Help
1. Check `README.md` for detailed instructions
2. Run `python test_system.py` to diagnose issues
3. Review console logs for error messages
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed
